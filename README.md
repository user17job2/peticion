In this project I'm going to try the MTDB(https://www.themoviedb.org/) API,
to make a website that gives you ideas, in case you don't know at the moment what movie to watch.

You'll can't watch the movie there, but you will know what seek.

i'll probably make changes for more options:) > but i'm not sure.

I proved sweetalert2(https://sweetalert2.github.io/) for the alert that change the web icon.

I'm glad with the results and i hape you too.
